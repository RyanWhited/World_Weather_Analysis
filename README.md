# World Weather Analysis - Trip Planning
## Summary
This challenge was based on adding features to a PlanMyTrip app. First, I added the weather description to the weather data. I then had the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
